# Embedding
## Learning Objectives: EMBEDDING**
## Convert movie-review string data to a sparse feature vector
## Implement a sentiment-analysis linear model using a sparse feature vector
## Implement a sentiment-analysis DNN model using an embedding that projects data into two dimensions
## Visualize the embedding to see what the model has learned about the relationships between words
